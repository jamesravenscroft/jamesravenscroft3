Before we remove this pulsing footer due to your overwhelming dissatisfaction with it's 
existance, we would like you to bestow upon us the true reason you so detest and loath this
footer, which took hundreds of hours of exhausting labor to produce.
<br><br>
We're certain that your disdain for our beautiful masterpiece is in no way malicious, but is merely an 
ode to the fact that some might consider this footer heinous. Others may say that it makes them nauseaus.
 Now certainly they are in their own right to disagree, but the fact is that they are undeniably incorrect. However, they are welcome
to their opinion. Which truth be told, when all is said and done and all the 
cards are on the table, is plain false. </p>

<br>Astute Mentat computators famously consider this Footer as the penultimate form of artistic
expression, a crowning acheivement in human ingenuity. But then again, its not for everyone. We get it.....
